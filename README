ccollect backups data from local or remote hosts to your local harddisk.


You can retriev the latest version of ccollect at [0].

doc/REQUIREMENTS           shows dependencies of ccollect.
doc/INSTALL                describes how to install it.
doc/configuration          describes how to configure it.
doc/configuration.example  is a log of how I created a configuration.


ccollect was inspired by rsnapshot [1], which had some problems:
   - configuration parameters had to be TAB seperated
   - you could not specify exclude lists differently for every source
   - no parallel execution
   - I didn't like the configuration at all, so I used the cconfig style [2].
