[Almost complete Copy of an e-mail from Patrick Drolet]

Hello again,



I have created a script to better manage  the backups since my
upload/download ratio and my bandwidth is limited by my ISP, and my hard
disk space is also somewhat limited.  The script is called
"ccollect_mgr.sh".



Provides the following features

1)      Determine the interval (daily/weekly/monthly)

a.       Define when you want weekly and monthly backups.  It takes care of
the rest

2)      Perform the backups using ccollect

3)      Copy the ccollect log output to the first backup of the set

a.       Keeping the detailed log of each backup is always handy!

4)      Build a periodic report and include the real amount of disk used

a.       Computes the real amount of disk used (eg: no double counting of
hard links)

b.      Shows the actual amount of data transferred

5)      Send an email if there has been errors or warnings

6)      Send a periodic email to show transfer size, real backup size, etc

a.       Weekly reports are nice.!

[...]

-          rdu (real du), which computes the real amount of disk used (no
double/triple counting hard links), same code as in ccollect_mgr.sh.

-          S60ccollect_example, an example script to put in etc/init.d to
add ccollect_mgr to the crontab
